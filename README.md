# Jake Backend
This project is a Node.js Express-based backend for an e-commerce website that connects consumers with business owners. The platform aims to provide a seamless experience for customers to browse and purchase products from reliable and vetted businesses. It also integrates payment and logistics functionalities to streamline the process of acquiring goods.

## Features

- **Business Vetting:** All businesses on the platform undergo a rigorous vetting process to ensure reliability and trustworthiness. This helps to establish a safe and secure environment for customers.

- **Account Creation:** Customers have the option to create accounts on the website. Account creation brings additional benefits such as personalized recommendations, order tracking, and saved payment and shipping information for faster checkout.

- **Product Browsing:** Customers can easily browse through various product categories, filter and sort products based on their preferences, and view detailed product information including images, descriptions, and pricing.

- **Shopping Cart:** Customers can add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout. The shopping cart provides a convenient way to manage selected items and review the final order before making a purchase.

- **Checkout Process:** The platform integrates payment gateways to facilitate secure and convenient transactions. Customers can select their preferred payment method, enter the necessary details, and complete the purchase. Order confirmation and receipt are provided upon successful transactions.

- **Order Tracking:** Customers with accounts can track the status of their orders, including shipping details and estimated delivery dates. This feature enhances transparency and improves the overall customer experience.

- **Logistics Integration:** The platform partners with reliable logistics providers to ensure smooth product delivery. Shipping information is securely shared with the logistics partner to provide accurate tracking updates and timely deliveries.
